# Introduction

Hey everyone, I've built a chess AI based on Minimax algorithm (Negamax implementation) & Alpha-beta pruning optimization. Minimax tries to find most optimal move for a player,
assuming that our opponent also plays optimally. Its a backtracking based algorithm, its tries all possible moves for given depth and then backtracks and makes a decision 
which is based on some heuristic evaluation of the leaf nodes.
